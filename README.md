Several countries have provided nutritional information regarding serving sizes to encourage citizens to make
healthier food choices. Knowing how serving size correlates with the other factors influencing dietary intake is important.
Particular attention should be paid to the effect of portion size
on calorie intake, as numerous extraneous factors exist, and it
must be clearly stated that portion size is the primary issue.
Studies have reported a lack of information on the serving size of
Pakistani food. This research attempts to collect data on Pakistani
food and estimate its portion sizes using deep learning techniques.
Our goal is to compile a database of traditional Pakistani recipes
so that citizens may acquire the nutrition information they need
to lead healthy lives.
